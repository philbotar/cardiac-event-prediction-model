# Preliminary Study

This is a document to note my findings between cardiac events and how we can try to predict them.

## What are we trying to discover?

Whether there is a possible correlation between the metrics of which are measured by bedside monitors and an ability to identify that a cardiac event will occur.

## What is a cardiac Event?

A cardiac event is an event that occurs to the heart. Examples include

- Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction): When a Blocked artery cuts off oxygen-rich blood to part of the heart muscle, causing it to die.
- Sudden Cardiac Arrest: An electrical malfunction causes the heart to suddenly stop beating effectively, leading to loss of consciousness and breathing
- Arrhythmias: Irregular heartbeats (too fast, too slow, or chaotic) that can disrupt blood flow and sometimes lead to arrest.
- And other events such as cardiomyopathy or blood clots.

## Wheres the data from ? What data will we use ?

We will use [MIMIC-IV Waveform Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimic4wdb/0.1.0/). This has all the data from bedside monitors in waveform on which we can create a model to watch.

## What are the Waveforms? How can they help us ?

Waveforms in this instance are different measures for the patient.

| **Type of Measurement**           | **Specific Signals/Labels**       | **Description & Sampling**                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**       | ECG, Leads (e.g., I, II, V, etc.) | Electrical activity of the heart. Typically 2-3 channels at 250 Hz.  |
| **Photoplethysmogram (PPG)**      | Pleth                             | Continuous blood volume change (optical sensor). Typically 125 Hz.   |
| **Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP)** | ABP                               | Continuous, invasive arterial pressure waveform. Typically 125 Hz.   |
| **Respiration**                   | RESP                              | Continuous respiratory wave (typically impedance-based).             |
| **Other Pressures**               | CVP, ICP                          | Central Venous Pressure or Intracranial Pressure (where applicable). |

## So what do these actually mean and how do they relate to Cardiac Events?

### ECG (Echocardiogram)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2214/

When a heart beats, the heart is depolarized to trigger its contraction. Heart depolarization is the electrical activation of heart muscle cells, triggered by an influx of positive ions (mainly sodium, then calcium) into the cells, making them less negative and causing them to contract. The ECG detects the electrical impulses generated by your heart as it beats, amplifying the data, plotting them as a graph that correspond to atrial and ventricular contraction and relaxation.

### PPG (Photoplethysmogram)

A PPG (Photoplethysmography) graph for the heart shows blood volume changes in tissues as a waveform, reflecting the heart's pumping action, with peaks representing heartbeats, used in smartwatches for HR/SpO2, relying on light absorption by blood, and revealing arterial stiffness via waveform shape.
