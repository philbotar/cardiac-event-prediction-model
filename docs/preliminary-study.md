# Preliminary Study

This is a document to note my findings between cardiac events and how we can try to predict them.

## What are we trying to discover?

Whether there is a possible correlation between the metrics of which are measured by bedside monitors and an ability to identify that a cardiac event will occur.

## What is a cardiac Event?

A cardiac event is an event that occurs to the heart. Examples include

- Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction): When a Blocked artery cuts off oxygen-rich blood to part of the heart muscle, causing it to die.
- Sudden Cardiac Arrest: An electrical malfunction causes the heart to suddenly stop beating effectively, leading to loss of consciousness and breathing
- Arrhythmias: Irregular heartbeats (too fast, too slow, or chaotic) that can disrupt blood flow and sometimes lead to arrest.
- And other events such as cardiomyopathy or blood clots.

## Wheres the data from ? What data will we use ?

We will use [MIMIC-IV Waveform Database](https://physionet.org/content/mimic4wdb/0.1.0/). This has all the data from bedside monitors in waveform on which we can create a model to watch.

## What are the Waveforms? How can they help us ?

Waveforms in this instance are different measures for the patient.

| **Type of Measurement**           | **Specific Signals/Labels**       | **Description & Sampling**                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**       | ECG, Leads (e.g., I, II, V, etc.) | Electrical activity of the heart. Typically 2-3 channels at 250 Hz.  |
| **Photoplethysmogram (PPG)**      | Pleth                             | Continuous blood volume change (optical sensor). Typically 125 Hz.   |
| **Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP)** | ABP                               | Continuous, invasive arterial pressure waveform. Typically 125 Hz.   |
| **Respiration**                   | RESP                              | Continuous respiratory wave (typically impedance-based).             |
| **Other Pressures**               | CVP, ICP                          | Central Venous Pressure or Intracranial Pressure (where applicable). |

## So what do these actually mean and how do they relate to Cardiac Events?

### ECG (Echocardiogram)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK2214/

When a heart beats, the heart is depolarized to trigger its contraction. Heart depolarization is the electrical activation of heart muscle cells, triggered by an influx of positive ions (mainly sodium, then calcium) into the cells, making them less negative and causing them to contract. The ECG detects the electrical impulses generated by your heart as it beats, amplifying the data, plotting them as a graph that correspond to atrial and ventricular contraction and relaxation.

### PPG (Photoplethysmogram)

https://www.news-medical.net/health/Photoplethysmography-(PPG).aspx#:~:text=PPG%20shows%20the%20blood%20flow,syncronization%20with%20the%20heart%20beat.

A PPG (Photoplethysmography) graph for the heart shows blood volume changes in tissues as a waveform, reflecting the heart's pumping action, with peaks representing heartbeats, used in smartwatches for HR/SpO2, relying on light absorption by blood, and revealing arterial stiffness via waveform shape.

### ABP (Arterial Blood Pressure)

This the force exerted by blood against arterial wall as the heart pumps. It has Systolic Pressure, which is the peak pressure during heart contraction, and Diastolic Pressure, which is the minimum pressure when the heart relaxes between beats.

The ABP Graph shows the pulsatile pattern, going in the following

1. Sharp upstroke (systolic rise) as the ventricle ejects blood
2. A peak (systolic pressure)
3. A decline with a small notch called the dicrotic notch (marks aortic valve closure)
4. Gradual decay to the trough (diastolic pressure)

This repeats over time.

### RESP (Respiration)

Respiratory Rate/Waveform (RESP) measures breathing activity, typically via impedance pneumography (electrodes detect chest wall movement) or airflow sensors.

RESP waveform shows

- Inspiration: Upward deflection as the chest expands
- Expiration: Downward return as it contracts
- A smooth wave pattern.

The y-axis represents relative chest impedance or airflow volume, and the x-axis is time. Respiratory rate (breaths per minute) is derived from counting wave cycles. Normal adult rate is 12–20 breaths/min.

### Heart Rate

Normal resting HR for adults is 60–100 bpm. Tachycardia (>100 bpm) or bradycardia (<60 bpm) can indicate stress, arrhythmias, or impending cardiac events. HR variability (HRV) — the variation in time between beats is a strong predictor of cardiac risk.

### Oxygen Saturation

SpO2 measures the percentage of hemoglobin in arterial blood that is saturated with oxygen. Normal range is 95–100%. Values below 90% indicate hypoxemia. Desaturation often precedes or accompanies cardiac deterioration, with terminal drops occurring ~14 minutes before circulatory arrest.

### Blood Pressure - Non-Invasive (NIBP)

NIBP is measured intermittently using an oscillometric cuff. It provides:

- NBPs (Systolic): Peak pressure during ventricular contraction
- NBPd (Diastolic): Minimum pressure during relaxation
- NBPm (Mean): Weighted average, approximated as DBP + ⅓(SBP - DBP)

Normal adult BP is ~120/80 mmHg. Hypotension (SBP <90 or MAP <65 mmHg) is associated with increased mortality and poor outcomes.

### Invasive Blood Pressure (ABPs, ABPd, ABPm)

These values come directly from a small tube (catheter) placed inside an artery, giving real-time, beat-by-beat readings from the ABP waveform. This is more accurate than the arm cuff method, especially when a patient's condition is unstable. Research shows that diastolic pressure (the lower number) is better at predicting patient outcomes than systolic or mean pressure.

### Respiratory Rate (Resp Rate)

Breath rate in breaths per minute, derived from the RESP waveform. Normal adult range is 12–20 breaths/min. Tachypnea (>20) may indicate distress, hypoxia, or metabolic acidosis. Bradypnea or apnea can precede cardiac events. Abnormal respiratory patterns often appear before hemodynamic collapse.

### Temperature

Body temperature measured at various sites—blood, core (rectal/bladder), or esophageal. Sampled infrequently. Fever may indicate infection or inflammation; hypothermia is used therapeutically post-cardiac arrest (targeted temperature management). Extreme deviations can affect cardiac electrical stability.
